There are three major stages in database design, each producing a progressively lower-
level description:

**Requirements analysis**

First, we determine and write down what exactly the database is needed for, what
data will be stored, and how the data items relate to each other. In practice, this
might involve detailed study of the application requirements and talking to people
in various roles that will interact with the database and application.

**Conceptual design**

Once we know what the database requirements are, we distill them into a formal
description of the database design. In this chapter, weâ€™ll see how to use modeling
to produce the conceptual design.

**Logical design**

Finally, we map the database design onto an actual database management system
and database tables.
