### HardInfo is a system profiler and benchmark for Linux systems.It is able to obtain information from both the hardware and the operating system, perform benchmarks, generate reports and organize it in a simple and intuitive GUI.


![The repository can be found here:](https://github.com/lpereira/hardinfo)

For Ubuntu users the software can be found in the Ubuntu software store for free!!


Further description:

 Information is grouped in four main groups: Computer, Devices, Network, and Benchmarks.

       The Computer group contains mostly information about basic software.  This includes but is
       not limited to  information  about  the  operating  system  (kernel  version,  C  library,
       distribution,  etc.),  kernel modules, locale information, filesystem usage, users/groups,
       and development tools.

       The Devices group contains information about the hardware, as detected  by  the  operating
       system.   Hardinfo  is incapable of detecting hardware by itself, it merely lists what the
       operating system was able to find.  This includes, but  does  not  limit  to,  information
       about  the  processor  (including  cache  layout, known bugs, and feature flags with their
       explanation), devices (such as USB, PCI, and Input devices), among other things.

       The Network group lists information about network interfaces, routing table, DNS  servers,
       and other networking-related topics.

       The  Benchmarks group allow performing simple benchmarks to test CPU and FPU capabilities,
       as well as some of the  graphical  user  interface  capabilities  as  well.   In  previous
       versions,  it  was  possible  to send the benchmark results to a central server, so it was
       possible to compare the benchmarks with  other  Hardinfo  users;  this  service  has  been
       deactivated in the mean time.

       Reports  can be generated either by invoking Hardinfo with special command-line parameters
       (see below), or by clicking the "Generate Report" button  in  the  GUI.   Reports  can  be
       customized in the GUI and saved in either HTML or plain text formats.
